# JAVA-SPRING-POSTGRESQL-ANGULAR

**! This project contains plenty of examples of how to configure and work with Spring Boot, Spring Security, PostgreSQL database, Hibernate framework, REST APIs, and even write tests using JUnit and Mockito. Also, Angular components, services, routing, and other usefull stuff can be found on the frontend side.**

An example of a working project with a **client-server** architecture, where:
* the **server** is written in Java and uses Spring Boot, Spring Security and PostgreSQL;
* the **client** is written in Angular

## App overview
This project is basically an application that allows one to perform CRUD operations on 3 entities: movies, clients and rentals. Between movies and clients there is a many to many relationship (since one movie can be rented by many clients and one client can rent many movies) which is mediated by the intermediate rentals entity (so basically we have a one to many relationship between movies and rentals, and a many to one relationship between rentals and clients).

**! Note that the application is very simplistic since its aim is only to provide the basics of how to work with and integrate all of the technologies and frameworks mentioned above.**

**Features of the application:**
* login & logout
* Add/Delete/Update/List/View details (of) movie(s)
* Add/Delete/Update/List/View details (of) client(s)
* Add/Delete/Update/List/View details (of) rental(s)
